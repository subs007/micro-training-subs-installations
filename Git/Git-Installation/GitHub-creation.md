C# reate your account page of GitHub website

Fill in each field for username, email address, and password. Choosing a username and email are especially important! Be sure to read through the following tips.

## Username
When choosing a username, it‚Äôs wise to choose one you wouldn‚Äôt mind future employers or colleagues seeing. A combination of your first and last name like firstnamelastname or using initials, like i_lastname, are good because they make it easy to find you on GitHub or identify you when you make pull requests or reviews. Remember, you‚Äôre likely using this account to share or access code.

Also be aware that usernames are first come, first serve and may not be available if someone else already claimed the username. Additionally, usernames may only contain alphanumeric characters and hyphens are not allowed at the beginning or end.

## Email Address
Like with usernames, pick an email that you‚Äôre comfortable sharing with peers and potential hires. Because of the way Git works, it‚Äôs important to note that your email can be exposed publicly when you make a pull request or merge in code to a repository, making it visible to anyone looking through your projects. When you sign up for a new GitHub account, your email address is hidden by default.

## Finish Creating Your Account
Lastly, fill out the password field. When you‚Äôre done filling out the various fields, verify your account. You will receive an email from GitHub prompting you to verify.

Once you see a green checkmark, click on the blue Create an Account button.

Go to your email account, find the email from GitHub, and click on the button inside it to finish creating your account.

# Settings
After successfully creating an account, you should see a page display asking you ‚ÄúWhat do you want to do first?‚Äù Go through the steps to complete your own set up process. You should now see a welcome page:

# GitHub Welcome page

You can either answer the optional questions or move on by clicking on the Complete setup button to finish creating your account.

Your browser should display a personal dashboard with a section for your projects and some messages:

setting your email to private

setting up two-factor authentication

That‚Äôs it, you now have your very own GitHub account. üéâ
